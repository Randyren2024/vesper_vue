The 50° Grip Tread edition uses aggressive tread tires for maximum slope climbing on 50° (119% grade) terrain. The 40° Wide Wheel edition uses wider TPU tires for a larger contact patch — preferred for soft soil, mud, and customers who want extra stability.' },
      { question: 'How long does the battery last and what is the maximum mowing area?', answer: 'Powered by 56V LiFePO₄ batteries with 1500 cycles — 3× the industry average. The 18Ah battery runs up to 2h 15m and covers up to 4500 ㎡ per charge. The 12Ah runs up to 1h 30m and covers 3000 ㎡. Charging from a 600W charger takes ~90 min (18Ah) and ~70 min (12Ah).' },
      { question: 'What safety features protect the operator and bystanders?', answer: 'The S1 has 4 ultrasonic sensors that detect obstacles, people, and pets — slowing or stopping the machine and blades on approach. A front bumper adds an impact buffer. Tilt and roll-over sensors automatically stop the blades if the unit tips beyond a safe angle.' },
      { question: 'Is it controlled only by a remote, and how far does it reach?', answer: 'Yes — operated entirely by the included remote control. Signal range reaches up to 400 m. For large areas, one-touch straight-line and one-touch turning functions are available. For safety and visual range, 100 m is the recommended working distance.' },
      { question: 'What mowing modes are available?', answer: 'Three primary modes: Mulching (cuts clippings into fine fragments that fertilize the lawn), Bagging (collects clippings in a rear bag for easy disposal), and Rear Discharge (expels clippings out the back for quick cleanup). The 4-in-1 add-on adds the leaf-shredding vacuum.' },
      { question: 'What maintenance does the S1 require?', answer: 'Routine maintenance is limited to blade replacement and machine cleaning. There is no oil, no spark plugs, no fuel filter. LiFePO₄ batteries need only a top-up charge every 3 months during long-term storage to stay above 70%.' }
